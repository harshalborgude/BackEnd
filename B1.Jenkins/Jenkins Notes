Jenkins 

1) What is continous integration - CI / Continous delievery - CD
	It is a development practice , in which developers are required to commit changes to source code in a shared repository several time a day.
	Every commit is then build and this allows the team to detect problems early.

2) what does CI really mean ?
	1) Integrated - all changes up until that point are combined into the project.
	2) Built - The code is compile into an executable or package.
	3) Tested - Automated test suits are run.
	4) Deployed - Loaded onto the system where developers can interact with it.
	
3) CI benefits ?
	1) Immediate bug detection.
	2) No integration steps in the lifecycle.
	3) A deployable system at any given point.
	4) record of evolution of project.
